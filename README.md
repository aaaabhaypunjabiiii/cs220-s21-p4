# Project 4: Pokémon Simulation

## Learning Objectives

In this project, you will walk through how to

  * Use conditional statements to write programs with more complicated logic
  * Practice writing more functions
  * Begin using good coding practices outlined in Lab P4
  
Please go through Lab P4 before working on this project. The lab introduces some useful techniques related to this project.

## Overview

For this project, you'll be using the data from `pokemon_stats.csv` to simulate Pokémon battles. This data was gathered by the Python program `gen_csv.ipynb` from the website https://www.pokemondb.net/. This project will focus on conditional statements. To start, download `project.py`, `test.py`, `type_effectiveness_stats.csv` and `pokemon_stats.csv`. You'll do your work in a Jupyter Notebook, producing a `main.ipynb` file. You'll test as usual by running `python test.py` to test a `main.ipynb` file.

We won't explain how to use the project module here (the code in the `project.py` file). The lab this week is designed to teach you how it works. So, before starting P4, take a look at Lab P4.

This project consists of writing code to answer 20 questions. If you're answering a particular question in a cell in your notebook, you need to put a comment in the cell so we know what you're answering. For example, if you're answering question 13, the first line of your cell should contain #q13.

In this project, you will have to write several functions and keep adding more details to them according to the instructions. When you are adding more things in your functions, we want you to follow the Good Coding Style for Functions described in Lab P4. Therefore, you should only keep the latest version of your functions in your notebook file. For example, in P4 you are asked to write 6 functions(`original_damage`, `type_effectiveness_against`, `effective_damage`, `num_hits`, `battle`, and `two_on_two_battle`), so there should only be the latest version of these 6 functions in your submitted notebook file.
